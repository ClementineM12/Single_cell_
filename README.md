# Single Cell Analysis of RNA-seq Data

This repository contains my project for the course "Bioinformatics and Computational Methods for Personalized Medicine" in my MSc.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the analysis of RNA-seq data from pancreatic cells using Python. The main steps of the analysis include:

1. Data Preprocessing: The toolkit of Scanpy is used for data preprocessing. This includes tasks such as quality control, normalization, and filtering of the RNA-seq data.

2. Dimensionality Reduction: Implementation of dimensionality reduction algorithms is performed to reduce the high-dimensional RNA-seq data into a lower-dimensional space. Various unsupervised and supervised techniques are utilized for this purpose.

3. Comparison of Results: The results obtained from different dimensionality reduction techniques are compared using specific metrics designed for each technique. This allows for an evaluation of the performance and suitability of the different approaches.
